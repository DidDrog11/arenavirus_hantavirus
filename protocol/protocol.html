<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>Current host-pathogen association datasets provide synthesised information on hosts and their pathogens but do not contain temporal or geographic information. These resources often provide linking information to publications reporting the association but information including accession numbers of archived sequences, number of individuals tested and measures of prevalence among sampled populations are not immediately retrievable. Using these resources for inference beyond host-pathogen associations is therefore limited. Here, we aim to produce a database of host-pathogen associations for two viral families of small mammals which contain several known zoonoses, namely Arenaviridae and Hantaviridae. This database can be used to explore the distribution of small mammal hosts of known and suspected pathogens and the extent to which they have been sampled. Further, linkage to sequence data of known zoonoses will support analysis of the risk of viral reassortment between viral species within geographically co-located host species.</p>
</section>
<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Arenaviruses and Hantaviruses are globally distributed pathogens primarily infecting rodents and other small mammals [ref]. Several of these pathogens sporadically spillover into human populations where they are responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality within their endemic regions [ref]. Arenaviruses, including <em>Mammarenavirus lassaense</em> (LASV) and <em>Mammarenavirus juninense</em> (JUNV) are causative agents of viral haemorrhagic fevers, Lassa fever in West Africa and Argentine haemorrhagic fever, while <em>Mammarenavirus choriomeningitidis</em> is believed to have a global distribution and is the cause of Lymphocytic choriomeningitis an aseptic meningitis [ref]. Hantaviruses, such as <em>Orthohantavirus puumalaense</em> (PUUV) and <em>Orthohantavirus seoulense</em> (SEOV) cause haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, while in the Americas <em>Orthohantavirus sinnombreense</em> (SNV) is the causative agent of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome [ref]. The distribution and human health impact of hantaviruses in Africa is poorly understood [ref].</p>
<p>Novel Arenaviruses and Hantaviruses continue to be described, with new species evolving and emerging in the Anthropocene [ref]. Deforestation, urbanization, and agricultural expansion bring humans into closer contact with rodent reservoirs, increasing the likelihood of spillover events. For instance, agricultural encroachment in West Africa has been linked to increased human exposure to LASV-carrying rodents. Changes in climate, land use, rodent ecology, and human behaviour alter human-reservoir contact, which is a component of a complex human-animal-environment nexus driving spillover and maintenance of novel pathogens [ref]. Extant pathogens remain endemic diseases with limited human-to-human transmission. There remains concern about the emergence of a novel strain of an existing or new pathogen that is able to sustain transmission within human populations, this has led to Lassa fever (LASV) being classed as a priority disease by the WHO [ref].</p>
<p>A broader understanding of the economic and societal impacts of these pathogens is also required. The economic burden of arenavirus and hantavirus infections extends beyond healthcare costs to include long-term productivity losses and the economic strain on already vulnerable populations. The Four Corners outbreak of HPS led to significant economic disruption in affected communities, demonstrating the far-reaching consequences of these diseases [ref]. Lasting health and wellbeing impacts following infection are also likely. Infection with LASV is presumed to lead to symptomatic Lassa fever in only 20% of infections, the remaining 80% are presumed to have asymptomatic disease [ref]. Sensorineural hearing impairment is considered a sequelae of symptomatic infection, the prevalence of this in the asymptomatic population has not been convincingly assessed and therefore disease associated morbidity may be substantially under-reported in the endemic region.</p>
<p>Small mammals, primarily rodents (Rodentia), but also shrews (Soricidae) are reservoirs of zoonotic arenaviruses and hantaviruses [ref]. Traditionally these pathogens, particularly hantaviruses have been considered single reservoir species but this paradigm is changing with increased pathogen surveillance in endemic settings. Multiple potential hosts have been identified for pathogens including LASV, SEOV and SNV. Similarly, a single host species may be a host of multiple arenaviruses and hantaviruses throughout its geographic distribution, for example <em>Mastomys natalensis</em>, the primary host of LASV is the host of at least 7 distinct arenaviruses throughout its range <span class="citation" data-cites="de2020dhati">[@de2020dhati]</span>.</p>
<p>TThe ecology of these hosts, including their population dynamics, behaviour, habitat preferences, and interactions within their communities, directly influences pathogen transmission dynamics. Linking ecological and genomic data allows for the identification of genetic markers associated with increased virulence or transmissibility, providing critical insights into the evolutionary trajectories of arenaviruses and hantaviruses [ref]. Small-mammal sampling to quantify these parameters, with or without pathogen data, is vital to better understand ecological factors driving pathogen spillover. Existing data on rodent-pathogen associations from these studies is typically at a local scale and often lack comprehensive geographic and temporal information limiting the ability to explore the full scope of host-pathogen interactions through synthesising disparate, non-standardise data sources.</p>
<p>An additional current limitation is the linkage of genomic data to the ecological context of the sample, introducing challenges to the assessment of viral evolution, reassortment, and novel pathogen emergence with zoonotic potential. A unified dataset could enable better predictive modeling and outbreak response strategies, addressing current data fragmentation that impairs accurate risk assessments and public health interventions.</p>
<p>A detailed dataset on the current state of sampling for arenaviruses and hantaviruses in wild caught small-mammals is therefore urgently needed. Synthesising spatial, temporal and genomic data from previously published small-mammal sampling studies will provide the most comprehensive index of host-pathogen associations for these viral families in addition to identifying locations and potential hosts that have been relatively undersampled and which may benefit from targeted viral discovery. This dataset is expected to provide a key resource for the development of targeted public health interventions, risk mapping and predictive modelling of future outbreaks.</p>
<p>The dataset will produce following the principles of the Open Science movement. We intend to share our research tools for study identification, data extraction and code for data processing on suitable platforms. By adhering to the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), the dataset will be accessible to researchers, policymakers, and public health officials worldwide, enhancing its impact on guiding evidence-based decision-making and fostering international collaboration in disease surveillance. The produced dataset will adhere to the FAIR guiding principles and will be submitted to a suitable data repository (e.g., the Global Biodiversity Information Facility) <span class="citation" data-cites="wilkinson2016fair gbif">[@wilkinson2016fair; @gbif]</span>.</p>
